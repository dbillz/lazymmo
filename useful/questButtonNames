I'm going to create quest buttons for each of these

Instead of the current single quest button, two random buttons will pop up. 

Each has a rarity attached to it, and the player chooses which to pick.
        This rewards actually reading them (or at least looking at the colors) instead of mindless spam click

Rare/epic ones give better rewards

Chance of having rare/epic events depends on your item level

or maybe some rare/epic ones will only show up for some item levels

eg raiding
